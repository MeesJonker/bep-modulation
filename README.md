**Bachelor Thesis Project - Digital Modulation System**

*Authors: Mees Jonker, Nadine van Dam*

This repository contains the code for a digital modulation system created for our bachelor graduation project (BEP). Our project involved designing an underwater communication system
based on quasi-static electric fields. This graduation assignment was set up by the company LOBSTER Robotics, who guided us along the way. The work was split into three groups: hardware (amplifier design), software (digital modulation), and channel characteristics research. Unfortunately, we are not
allowed to share our thesis report, as LOBSTER requested it to stay confidential. However, below is a short introduction to our thesis.

*Unmanned underwater vehicles benefit from communication with a high data rate on relatively small
distances (under 100 m). Existing communication methods are not able to provide this or present
other shortcomings. Therefore, this bachelor end project focuses on a new type of underwater communication, quasi-static electric field communication. The software and modulation techniques in such
a communication system are covered in this thesis. This includes a detailed analysis of modulation
techniques, and especially of differential methods such as ùúã/ùëÄ-DPSK, which can be demodulated
non-coherently. Our system implements OFDM and according to simulations, it is able to achieve data
rates of up to 1 Mbit/s. Additionally, this research focuses on the effect of error correction coding on
the performance of the system. Moreover, an adaptive data rate control system is designed. The efficiency of the system is optimized by a power distribution algorithm. Finally, suggestions are given for
a communication protocol.*

This repository contains the Python code for the various (single-carrier) digital modulation techniques that we have implemented (amplitude shift keying, frequency shift keying, QAM, etc.). 
Further, OFDM has been implemented to allow multi-carrier modulation. Further, we have spent time on investigating error correction codes, and we have included
Hamming codes in our design to control the trade-off between data speed and bit error rate. Further, we have implemented the 'water filling' algorithm, which distributes
divides the transmitted power over the available frequency bands based on the noise and attenuation in each of these bands.

The modulation systems implemented here have been succesfully tested both in simulations and in a real-world underwater testing scenario using actual hardware designed by our fellow team members. Finally,
it should be noted that this was a project with a very limited time span (10 weeks). This is why we chose to work with Python, which allowed
us to develop our initial system quite fast. We are aware that many of our implementations are far from efficient when it comes to computational complexity.
However, as this was meant to be a proof of concept with limited time, we chose not to focus on optimizing for computation time. 

The project was graded 8.5/10 and we were awarded the Best Bachelor Business Idea Award for our accompanying business plan for this system.
